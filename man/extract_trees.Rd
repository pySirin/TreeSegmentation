\title{Extract individual las files for segmented trees}
\usage{
extract_trees(las = NULL, algorithm = "silva", cores = NULL, output)
}
\arguments{
\item{las}{Character or Vector. Path to lidar tiles on system to be processed. May be a single tile or vector of tiles.}

\item{algorithm}{Character. A vector of lidar unsupervised classification algorithm(s). Currently "silva","dalponte","li" and "watershed" are implemented. See \code{\link[lidR]{lastrees}}}

\item{output}{Character. A set of "las" objects or a dataframe "df" of the xyz data, depending on the next processing step.}
}
\value{
A list object for each las tile processed. Each list is a list of segmented trees, either in las or dataframes, based on the output argument.
}
\description{
\code{extra_trees} computes an lidar-based segmentation, based on multiple available methods, and splits the results into individual las files for each predicted tree.
