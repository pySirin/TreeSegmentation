\title{Wrapper for calculating overlap among predictiong and ground truth polygons for lidar-based tree segmentation methods}
\usage{
evaluate(ground_truth, algorithm = "silva", path_to_tiles = NULL,
  extra = F, plot_results = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{ground_truth}{SpatialPolygonDataFrame of ground truth polygons}

\item{algorithm}{Character. A vector of lidar unsupervised classification algorithm(s). Currently "silva","dalponte","li" and "watershed" are implemented. See \link{\code[lidR]{lastrees}}}

\item{path_to_tiles}{Character. Location of lidar tiles on system.}

\item{extra}{Logical. Return a list of segmented lidar tiles, predicted convex hull polygons, and the calculated evaluation statistics.}

\item{plot_results}{Logical. Generate a plot of ground truth and predicted polygons}
}
\value{
dataframe of the jaccard overlap among polygon pairs for each selected method. If extra=T, \code{evaluate} will return a list object of results, predicted polygons, as well as output lidR tiles. See e.g. \link{\code{silva2016}}
}
\description{
\code{evaluate} computes an lidar based segmentation, assigns polygons to closest match and calculates jaccard stat
}
