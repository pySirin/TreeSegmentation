\title{Generate a ground model from raw las}
\usage{
ground_model(las, ground = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{las}{A lidar cloud read in by lidR package}

\item{ground}{Logical. Should a ground model be computed? Some tiles come pre-processed.}
}
\value{
NA. By default operation is done in place to reduce memory.

\description{
\code{ground_model} computes a ground model and normalizes the input point cloud such that ground points are at zero elevation

\examples{
LASfile <- system.file("extdata", "MixedConifer.laz", package="lidR")
tile = readLAS(LASfile, select = "xyz", filter = "-drop_z_below 0"
