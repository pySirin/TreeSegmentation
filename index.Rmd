# TreeSegmentation

An R package to replicate the work using ensemble tree segmentation methods in R.

This package follows the "Research Compendium" [philosophy](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg/blob/master/README.md) advocated by ROpenSci.

# Installation

Source can be cloned directly

```
git clone https://github.com/weecology/TreeSegmentation.git
```

Or installed directly into R.

```
library(devtools)
install_github("Weecology/TreeSegmentation")
```

## Package structure
* \analysis - The main analysis scripts to generate trees from lidR clouds
* \data - The publically available data.

The main analysis document is Evaluate.Rmd. The knitted html can be viewed [here](analysis/Evaluate.html).

# Status 

Below is a chart of the mean accuracy for the testing set of ground truth tree crowns.

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=F,echo=F}
library(ggplot2)
results<-read.csv("analysis/Results/results.csv")[,-1]
colnames(results)<-c("Algorithm","mean","median","date")

#set as date
results$date<-strptime(results$date,format="%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S")
ggplot(results,aes(x=as.Date(date),y=max(mean))) + geom_line() + geom_point() + ylim(0,1) + scale_x_date() + labs(x="Date",y="Mean Accuracy (IoU)") + theme_bw()
```
